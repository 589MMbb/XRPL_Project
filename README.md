# XRPL Building Air-Rights

## Overview
This application provides a comprehensive workflow for real estate professionals or enthusiasts who wish to tokenize air rights on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It combines several steps into one integrated system, including:

- Input and storage of building data
- Calculation of air rights based on building parameters
- Generation of NFT metadata
- Minting of NFTs on the XRPL Testnet

## Features
- **Building Data Management**: Enter and save details about buildings, such as name, zoning, land area, and other pertinent details.
- **Air Rights Calculation**: Calculate the value of air rights in both USD and XRP using user-inputted existing and maximum buildable square footage.
- **Metadata Generation**: Create metadata for the NFT that will represent the air rights on the blockchain.
- **NFT Minting**: Mint the NFT on the XRPL Testnet, with the ability to view transaction details.
